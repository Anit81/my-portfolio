Hi! I’m Faustina, a dedicated Frontend Developer and React Enthusiast who loves turning creative ideas into clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences.

I specialize in building modern interfaces using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a strong focus on performance, accessibility, and mobile-first design.

My journey into tech grew from a love for creating beautiful things — a skill I first developed through fashion and tailoring, where I learned precision, patience, and attention to detail. Now, I apply that same mindset to writing well-structured, elegant code.

I’ve built and deployed several projects using React, integrated APIs, and hosted live demos on Netlify and GitHub Pages. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think critically and bring real value to users.

I’m currently open to Frontend Developer roles, remote opportunities, and collaborations where I can contribute to building impactful digital products.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
